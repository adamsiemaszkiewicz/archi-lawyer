# üèõÔ∏è‚öñÔ∏èü§ñ Archi Lawyer Chatbot

## Overview

The Archi Lawyer Chatbot is a sophisticated tool designed to offer architects legal insights on building codes. This chatbot leverages RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to source information from actual regulation PDFs, providing architects with precise and reliable advice. It employs OpenAI API for natural language processing, Langchain for document retrieval, and Pinecone for efficient indexing and searching.

**Knowledge Base:** [Building Regulations and Approved Documents Index](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/building-regulations-and-approved-documents-index)

## Sample Usage

To get started, you can ask questions related to building regulations. For example:

**Sample Question:**
"In the context of food preparation areas, what are the key requirements for sink provision according to Requirement G6, and how does it differ in dwellings and buildings other than dwellings?"

**Location of the answer in the document:**
Page 739 of the document
